# Pete and Lucy

Pete is a resit from the last cohort and has expressed concern about his ability to last on the cohort. He has also mentioned that when a student discussed their progress in the cohort channel, he felt really bad about himself.

Lucy is also quite insecure about her coding experience, but is positive about her progress so far.
