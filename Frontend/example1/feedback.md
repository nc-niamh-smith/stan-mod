# Feedback

## 27th February 2024

- First instinct is to put the repo into GitPod.
- They've sent a repo within a repo - can cd in with gitpod, would probably bounce this back if it was the first ticket, but at this point (ticket 5), I would just add it to their feedback.
- Mispelt 'components' in the App.jsx: there's an error straight away - I think a resubmit is reasonable at this point.
(Take a screenshot of the erorr, then send that to the student explaining the error. Then I'd fix it in gitpod and then send them how to fix it as well and continuing to give feedback)

-Go to the browser version first, to see about if the navigation is user-friendly

Browser
- Would make a suggestion 'as a user, I would expect ...' regarding navigating to the list of articles, and also for the ability to click onto the title/image rather than a 'view article' button.
- A home/return button on the indivdiual article page would be nice 
- URL missing from the articles page

Code - 
- Make a comment about how DisplayArticle is very busy - ask them to split into more components
- Spelling mistakes in DisplayArticle too as well as 6 pieces of state
- Initialising comments as 'false' makes no sense - should be consistent in
  
"Future" code -
A good practice that we should adhere to is one ticket per pr - there's the overlap that might happen in the dev world.
Plus, we're giving them feedback, so therefore we should be available to confirm that the changes they have made are suitable.

We didn't look at the plan, because they were on ticket 5 so therefore it felt like a moot point. We also knew there was more to comment on code-wise, but made the decision to stop where we were because of how much information we were giving to the student, and we didn't want to overwhelm them.

### General discussion of Frontend Project week:
- Earlier tickets, we tend to give more feedback.
- Our comments become less descriptive as the week goes on - especially when we're repeating ourselves.
