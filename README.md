# stan-mod
Standardisation and Moderation examples


The stan-mod repo is split into areas of the course - fundamentals, backend and frontend.

The goal of this repo is to provide examples of student work / potential issues that we have faced before in order to collaborate on our feedback - ensuring that every student is getting the same standard of feedback.
