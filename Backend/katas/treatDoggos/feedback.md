# treatDoggos Feedback

## 28th March 2024

Test suite: 
- not considered a mixed array / or any dogs starting as false (: would give feedback on the kata - probably is a theme to look out for in other katas)
- lacks semantic descriptions and variable names: would give feedback on the kata
- not quite understood what the describe is doing (doubling up!) (generalised misunderstanding)
- feels like they've written all the tests, then the solution, or have done a solution-first approach.

Solution: 
- misunderstanding of let v const
- unnecessarily looping twice
- feels like we should bring up this in a stand up, they're not as experienced as they claim to be.

Overall thoughts: 
- They've completed the question, but they've not put that much thought into it. Seems very rushed.
- They've definitely missed some behaviour, but ultimately from looking at the solution, it suggests that they have done TDD.
- We know the empty array test would have auto-passed, we would check to see if this is a regular occurrence in their test suites/code.
- Watch out for this happening again - if it did, then bring it to the seminar group.
- As a rule, we should probably look at each other's feedback on our mentees when going to 1-2-1s.
